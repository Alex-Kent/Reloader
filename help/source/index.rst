   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Reloader's documentation!
============================================

Reload selected layer(s).

Simple utility to reload/reopen selected layer(s). Reloading updates the data,
reopen also updates the extent. Also provides an option to watch layer
for changes to local file paths and reloads them automatically.
Useful when you're editing the underlying data on the fly in some other program.

Contents:
