Reload selected layer(s).

Simple utility to reload/reopen selected layer(s). Reloading updates the data,
reopen also updates the extent. Also provides an option to watch layer
for changes to local filepaths and reloads them automatically.
Useful when you're editing the underlying data on the fly in some other program.
